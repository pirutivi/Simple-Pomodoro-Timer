# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro Timer built using Python and Tkinter.

## Description
This is a Pomodoro technique-based timer that helps with productivity by alternating between work and break sessions. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) with a countdown timer and visual indicators for completed work sessions.

## Features
- **Work Session**: 25-minute work intervals
- **Short Break**: 5-minute breaks after each work session
- **Long Break**: 20-minute break after every 4 work sessions
- **Start and Reset buttons**
- **Visual checkmarks** for completed work sessions

## How It Works
1. Click the **Start** button to begin a 25-minute work session.
2. After the session, a break (short or long) will start automatically.
3. The timer alternates between work and break sessions following the Pomodoro technique.
4. Click **Reset** to stop and reset the timer at any point.
